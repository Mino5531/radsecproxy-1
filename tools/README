Mail[1] to the radsecproxy mailing list Wed, 14 Apr 2010 from Stefan
Winter explaining the radsec-dynsrv.sh and naptr-eduroam.sh scripts.

------------------------------------------------------------
Hi,

the radsec-dynsrv.sh script right now looks up _radsec._tcp.$REALM. For
eduroam, the production discovery will rely on S-NAPTRs of "s" type and
subsequent SRVs.

I have attached a preliminary version of the discovery script which
takes this logic into account. It could use some public scrutiny (where
"public" might very well evaluate to Kolbj√∏rn Barmen, who wrote the SRV
script and knows much more about bash scripting than I do *cough cough*).

As with the other script, you call

naptr-eduroam.sh <realm>

If you need a test case, the DNS domain restena.lu has the NAPTR and the
SRV record live in place. On my system, you get:

> ./naptr-eduroam.sh restena.lu
server dynamic_radsec.restena.lu {
host radius-1.restena.lu:2083
type TLS
}

with our live DNS data (radius-1.restena.lu isn't really
production-ready yet though).

If you're curious, the S-NAPTR for eduroam right now is

x-eduroam:radius.tls

with a possibility of a later IETF allocation of either

aaa:radius.tls (probable)
eduroam:radius.tls (wishful thinking)

, in which case changing the script to use the new ones is trivial.

Greetings,

Stefan Winter
