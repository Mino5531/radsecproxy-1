Thanks to Stefan Winter and Andreas Solberg for talking me into doing
this, and the funding from GEANT2.  Stefan as well as Kolbj√∏rn Barmen,
Ralf Paffrath and Maja Wolniewicz have helped with early testing of
the code.

Thanks for contributing code goes to Arne Schwabe, Maja Wolniewicz,
Simon Leinen and Stefan Winter.

All of the above plus Milan Sova have provided good feedback on
several implementation choices.  Finally thanks to Hans Zandbelt for
providing the autoconf stuff.  I may have forgotten someone, let me
know if you feel left out.
